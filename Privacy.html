<h3>Types of Data Collected</h3>

<h4>Personal Data</h4>
<p>While using Our Service, We may ask You to provide Us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify You. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Email address</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First name and last name (if You choose to provide it)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>User-generated content such as mood logs, journal entries, notes and other information You choose to store in the Application</p>

    <p>Subscription and purchase information (type of plan, status, renewal date) related to in-app purchases or subscriptions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Usage Data and analytics information</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Usage Data</h4>
<p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service.</p>
<p>Usage Data may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), operating system type and version, the type of mobile device You use, Your mobile device's unique identifiers, the time and date of Your use of the Service, time spent in different screens, in-app actions and other diagnostic data.</p>

<h4>Tracking Technologies and Cookies</h4>
<p>We and Our Service Providers may use Cookies and similar tracking technologies (such as mobile identifiers, SDKs and analytics tools) to monitor and analyze the use of Our Service and to store certain information.</p>
<p>Although the Application does not generally use traditional browser Cookies, it may use technologies that function in a similar way to Cookies for analytics, diagnostics, subscription management and security purposes. You can control or reset your mobile advertising identifier and certain tracking settings in your device settings.</p>

<h4>Analytics</h4>
<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service, including but not limited to Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics for Firebase and similar tools provided by Google LLC and its affiliates.</p>
<p>Analytics tools collect information such as how often users visit the Service, which screens are viewed and what actions are taken. We use this information to improve our Service and user experience. Analytics providers may collect the IP address assigned to You on the date you use the Service, as well as device identifiers and Usage Data. They do not receive Your name or other directly identifying Personal Data from us as part of this process.</p>
<p>You can learn more about how Google uses information from apps that use its services by reviewing its Privacy Policy. Depending on Your jurisdiction, You may also be able to opt out of certain analytics or limit ad tracking in Your device settings.</p>

<h3>AI Services and Chat Assistant</h3>
<p>The Service includes an AI-powered chat assistant and other tools that generate responses based on Your input. When You use these features, the text You enter (which may include mood-related information, journal-style messages or other details You choose to share) is sent to third-party AI service providers to generate a reply.</p>
<p>In particular, We use AI models provided by Anthropic PBC ("Anthropic"), such as the Claude family of models (for example, Claude Haiku 3), via their application programming interface (API). Anthropic processes this information on Our behalf for the sole purpose of generating responses and providing, maintaining and improving the AI functionality of the Service.</p>
<p>Data processed by Anthropic may be transferred to and processed on servers located outside Your country (including in the United States or other countries). We use contractual and technical measures, where appropriate, to help ensure that such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>We do not sell Your chat content, and We do not authorize AI providers to use Your chat data for their own marketing to You. However, their processing of data as Our processor is also governed by their own terms and privacy documentation, which We encourage You to review. You should avoid sharing highly sensitive information in the chat that You are not comfortable disclosing, even though We take steps to protect Your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Firebase and Other Infrastructure Services</h3>
<p>We use Firebase, a platform provided by Google LLC, as part of the infrastructure for the Service. Firebase may process Personal Data such as Your email address, authentication tokens, device information, User-generated content and Usage Data on Our behalf.</p>
<p>We use, or may use, Firebase Authentication to allow You to sign in securely, Firebase database services (such as Cloud Firestore) to store Your entries and other data, Firebase Analytics to better understand how the Service is used, and Firebase Crashlytics to help diagnose and fix crashes and performance issues. Data processed by Firebase may be stored on servers located in the United States or other countries.</p>
<p>Firebase acts as a data processor and processes Your Personal Data only according to Our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>RevenueCat and Subscription Management</h3>
<p>We use RevenueCat to manage in-app purchases, subscriptions and entitlements for the Service. RevenueCat receives information from the app stores (such as Apple App Store or Google Play) about Your purchases, including:</p>

  <li>Purchase and renewal dates</li>
  <li>Subscription status (active, expired, cancelled, in trial)</li>
  <li>Identifiers needed to validate and synchronize Your entitlements across devices</li>
</ul>
<p>RevenueCat processes this data on Our behalf to verify Your purchases, unlock premium features, manage subscription status and provide aggregated analytics about revenue and usage. RevenueCat does not receive Your full payment card number from Us; payment information is handled by the app store and its payment processors.</p>
